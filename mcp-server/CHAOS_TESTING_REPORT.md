### 7. ⚡ Stress Test - Rapid Mixed Operations
**Test Coverage:** 50 rapid sequential operations mixing create, update, delete, validate, and list commands.

**Results:**
- **Total operations:** 50
- **Successful:** 33 (66.0%)
- **Failed:** 17 (34.0%)
- **Total duration:** 114ms
- **Average per operation:** 2.28ms
- **Unity commands sent:** 50
