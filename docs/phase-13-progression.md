# Phase 13: Asset Pipeline Management - Progress Tracking

## Phase Overview
Implementing comprehensive Unity asset pipeline management including importing, search/filtering, file operations, folder management, and metadata analysis.

## Implementation Status: ðŸ”´ Not Started

### Phase 13.1: Asset Search and Metadata (Week 1)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Target:** Implement AssetSearchHandler.cs and AssetMetadataHandler.cs

#### Unity Handlers
- [ ] `AssetSearchHandler.cs` - Asset search with filters and pagination
- [ ] `AssetMetadataHandler.cs` - Asset info, labels, and preview generation
- [ ] Search optimization and result caching
- [ ] Asset dependency analysis integration

#### MCP Server Tools
- [ ] `AssetSearchToolHandler.js` - Search interface with pagination
- [ ] `AssetMetadataToolHandler.js` - Metadata and preview operations
- [ ] Search result formatting and filtering
- [ ] Performance optimization for large projects

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for asset search operations
- [ ] Unit tests for metadata extraction
- [ ] Large project performance testing
- [ ] Search accuracy validation
- [ ] Pagination functionality testing

#### Documentation
- [ ] Search syntax documentation
- [ ] Filter options reference
- [ ] Performance guidelines

### Phase 13.2: File Operations and Folder Management (Week 2)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Target:** Implement AssetFileHandler.cs and FolderManagementHandler.cs

#### Unity Handlers
- [ ] `AssetFileHandler.cs` - File operations (duplicate, move, rename, delete)
- [ ] `FolderManagementHandler.cs` - Folder operations and management
- [ ] Safety validations and dependency checking
- [ ] GUID preservation and reference updating

#### MCP Server Tools
- [ ] `AssetFileToolHandler.js` - File operation interface
- [ ] `FolderManagementToolHandler.js` - Folder management interface
- [ ] Operation validation and confirmation
- [ ] Batch operation support

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for file operations
- [ ] Unit tests for folder management
- [ ] Reference preservation testing
- [ ] Error recovery testing
- [ ] Batch operation validation

### Phase 13.3: Asset Importing (Week 3)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Target:** Implement AssetImportHandler.cs with progress monitoring

#### Unity Handlers
- [ ] `AssetImportHandler.cs` - Asset import operations
- [ ] Import settings management per asset type
- [ ] Progress monitoring and error reporting
- [ ] Asynchronous import handling

#### MCP Server Tools
- [ ] `AssetImportToolHandler.js` - Import interface
- [ ] Import progress reporting
- [ ] Import settings templates
- [ ] Error handling and validation

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for import operations
- [ ] Import settings validation
- [ ] Progress monitoring testing
- [ ] Error handling verification
- [ ] Multiple file type testing

## Current Priorities
1. **Asset Search Foundation** - Start with search and metadata as core functionality
2. **Performance Planning** - Design pagination and caching strategy
3. **Safety System** - Plan validation and backup mechanisms

## Dependencies
- Unity AssetDatabase APIs
- File system access permissions
- Progress reporting infrastructure
- Backup and validation systems

## Known Risks
- Large project performance degradation
- File corruption during operations  
- Import settings complexity
- Cross-platform path handling

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Search performance under 500ms for typical queries
- [ ] Safe file operations with rollback capability
- [ ] Import progress monitoring functional
- [ ] Support for all major asset types
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Full test coverage achieved

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Targets
- Search queries: < 500ms for projects with 10k+ assets
- File operations: < 100ms for single operations
- Import operations: Progress reporting every 100ms
- Memory usage: < 100MB for search indexing

### Safety Measures
- Pre-operation validation
- Backup critical assets before destructive operations
- Reference integrity checking
- Operation rollback capability

## Next Steps
1. Research Unity AssetDatabase performance characteristics
2. Design search indexing strategy
3. Plan file operation safety mechanisms
4. Create asset type import setting templates
