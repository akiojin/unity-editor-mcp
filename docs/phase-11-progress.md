# Phase 11: Component System Implementation Progress

## Overview
Phase 11 adds comprehensive component manipulation capabilities to Unity MCP, enabling adding, removing, and modifying Unity components on GameObjects through MCP.

## Phase Status: üîµ Planning
- ‚úÖ Planning document created
- ‚è≥ Implementation not started
- ‚è≥ Testing not started
- ‚è≥ Documentation not started

## Milestones

### 1. Planning & Design ‚úÖ
- [x] Analyze current capabilities
- [x] Identify gaps in component handling
- [x] Design component operation APIs
- [x] Plan implementation phases
- [x] Create technical specifications

### 2. Core Implementation (Phase 1) ‚è≥
- [ ] Create Unity ComponentHandler.cs
  - [ ] AddComponent method
  - [ ] RemoveComponent method
  - [ ] ModifyComponent method
  - [ ] ListComponents method
  - [ ] Component type resolution
  - [ ] Property value conversion
- [ ] Create MCP server handlers
  - [ ] AddComponentToolHandler.js
  - [ ] RemoveComponentToolHandler.js
  - [ ] ModifyComponentToolHandler.js
  - [ ] ListComponentsToolHandler.js
- [ ] Update UnityEditorMCP.cs with new commands
- [ ] Register handlers in MCP server

### 3. Advanced Features (Phase 2) ‚è≥
- [ ] GetComponentTypesToolHandler implementation
- [ ] Support for complex properties (arrays, nested objects)
- [ ] Custom MonoBehaviour script support
- [ ] Batch component operations
- [ ] Component dependency handling

### 4. Testing & Validation ‚è≥
- [ ] Unit tests for type conversion
- [ ] Integration tests for all handlers
- [ ] Edge case testing
  - [ ] Multiple components of same type
  - [ ] Component dependencies
  - [ ] Invalid properties
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Error handling validation

### 5. Documentation ‚è≥
- [ ] API documentation for all handlers
- [ ] Component property reference
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Common patterns guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Current Tasks
1. ‚è≥ Review and approve Phase 11 plan
2. ‚è≥ Begin implementation of ComponentHandler.cs
3. ‚è≥ Create component type registry

## Completed Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Created phase planning document
2. ‚úÖ Analyzed current component capabilities
3. ‚úÖ Designed component operation APIs

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Component Naming**: Support both short names ("Rigidbody") and full names ("UnityEngine.Rigidbody")
2. **Property Access**: Support both dot notation and nested objects
3. **Validation**: Three-layer validation (client, server, Unity)
4. **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with recovery suggestions

## Open Questions
1. How to handle custom user scripts/MonoBehaviours?
2. Should we limit which components can be added for security?
3. How to handle editor-only components?
4. Batch operations API design - arrays or separate endpoint?

## Risk Areas
1. **Type Resolution**: Finding components across all assemblies
2. **Property Conversion**: Complex Unity types from JSON
3. **Performance**: Reflection-heavy operations
4. **Security**: Preventing malicious component usage

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All core Unity components supported
- [ ] Property modification works for 90%+ of properties
- [ ] Operations complete in <100ms
- [ ] Zero crashes from invalid operations
- [ ] Clear error messages for all failure cases

## Dependencies
- Unity reflection APIs
- Newtonsoft.Json for serialization
- Unity Editor assemblies for component discovery

## Next Sprint Goals
1. Implement basic AddComponent functionality
2. Test with 5 core component types
3. Create property conversion utilities
4. Set up component type registry

## Phase Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1 (Core)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2 (Advanced)**: 2-3 days  
- **Phase 3 (Polish)**: 1-2 days
- **Total**: ~1 week

## Notes
- Component system is critical for dynamic Unity scene manipulation
- This phase significantly expands Unity MCP capabilities
- Focus on safety and validation to prevent Unity crashes
- Consider future UI component editor integration

## Related Phases
- Phase 10: Dialog Prevention (Completed)
- Phase 12: TBD (Possibly prefab system enhancements)
