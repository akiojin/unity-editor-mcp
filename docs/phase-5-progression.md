# Phase 5: Cleanup and Refactoring - Progression

## Current Status: Starting Phase 5
- **Started**: December 23, 2024
- **Goal**: Clean up technical debt and improve code quality without breaking functionality

## Pre-Phase Checklist
- [x] All existing MCP tools working
- [x] Unity connection stable
- [x] Test suite passing
- [x] Backup of working state

## Task Progress

### 1. Test Consolidation ‚è≥ In Progress

**Update**: Found test organization is more complex than expected:
- 3 different integration test files with different content
- Test migration script had path issues
- Decided to take a simpler approach: fix in place first

#### 1.1 Document Current Test Coverage
- [x] List all test files and their locations (created phase-5-test-inventory.md)
- [x] Identify duplicate tests (found 3 integration test variants)
- [ ] Document current test coverage metrics
- [x] Create test migration plan

#### 1.2 Create New Test Structure
- [ ] Create `/mcp-server/tests/unit/` directory
- [ ] Create `/mcp-server/tests/integration/` directory
- [ ] Create `/mcp-server/tests/e2e/` directory
- [ ] Create subdirectories mirroring source structure

#### 1.3 Migrate Tests (TDD Approach)
- [ ] Run current tests and save output
- [ ] Move config tests
- [ ] Move unityConnection tests
- [ ] Move handler tests
- [ ] Move tool tests
- [ ] Move integration tests
- [ ] Merge duplicate integration.test.js files
- [ ] Verify all tests still pass
- [ ] Remove old test files

### 2. Handler Registration Refactoring ‚úÖ Completed

#### 2.1 Design New Registry System
- [x] Write tests for handler registry
- [x] Design registry interface
- [x] Plan migration strategy

#### 2.2 Implement Registry
- [x] Create HANDLER_CLASSES array registry
- [x] Eliminate duplicate imports
- [x] Reduce 110 lines to 87 lines
- [x] Verify all handlers still work

### 3. Extract Common Utilities ‚úÖ Completed

#### 3.1 Identify Common Patterns
- [x] Document all validation duplications (found Vector3 duplication)
- [x] List common error patterns
- [x] Identify shared constants

#### 3.2 Create Utility Modules
- [x] Create utils/validators.js with comprehensive validators
- [x] Create validators.test.js with 17 passing tests
- [x] Implemented validators for Vector3, range, strings, booleans, layers, paths

#### 3.3 Update Handlers
- [x] Updated CreateGameObjectToolHandler to use common validators
- [x] Updated ModifyGameObjectToolHandler to use common validators
- [x] Verified handlers still work correctly after refactoring

### 4. Error Handling Standardization üìã Planned

#### 4.1 Define Error Strategy
- [ ] Document error handling patterns
- [ ] Create error class hierarchy
- [ ] Define logging strategy

#### 4.2 Implement Consistent Handling
- [ ] Create custom error classes
- [ ] Replace console.error with logger
- [ ] Standardize connection error handling
- [ ] Update all handlers

### 5. Project Structure Cleanup ‚è≥ In Progress

#### 5.1 Remove Unnecessary Files
- [x] Remove mcp-config-example.json
- [x] Remove fix-newtonsoft.md
- [x] Remove test-connection.md
- [x] Remove run-tests.sh

#### 5.2 Clean Directories
- [x] Remove empty unity-editor-mcp/Editor/Tools/Scene/
- [ ] Organize documentation files
- [ ] Clean up root directory

### 6. Code Quality Improvements üìã Planned

#### 6.1 Configuration Extraction
- [ ] Create config module for constants
- [ ] Move hardcoded values to config
- [ ] Add environment variable support

#### 6.2 Type Safety
- [ ] Add JSDoc annotations to all functions
- [ ] Document parameter types
- [ ] Document return types

### 7. Tool Consolidation Analysis üìã Planned

#### 7.1 Analysis
- [ ] Document current tool usage
- [ ] Compare with reference implementation
- [ ] Survey user experience impact

#### 7.2 Planning
- [ ] Create consolidation proposal
- [ ] Design migration path
- [ ] Plan backwards compatibility

## Completed Tasks
1. ‚úÖ Created Phase 5 planning document
2. ‚úÖ Created Phase 5 progression document
3. ‚úÖ Removed unnecessary root files (4 files)
4. ‚úÖ Cleaned up empty directories (unity-editor-mcp/Editor/Tools/Scene/)
5. ‚úÖ Refactored handler registration system (reduced 110 lines to 87)
6. ‚úÖ Extracted common validation utilities (created validators.js with tests)
7. ‚úÖ Updated handlers to use common validators

## Current Blockers
- None

## Test Results Log
```
Date: TBD
Test Suite: TBD
Results: TBD
```

## Notes
- Following strict TDD approach - no changes without tests
- Maintaining backwards compatibility throughout
- Each step verified with full test suite

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete test consolidation
2. Begin handler registry refactoring
3. Start extracting common utilities
