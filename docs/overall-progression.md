## Current Sprint: Phase 1.1

### Why Phase 1.1?
Comparison with reference implementation revealed architectural improvements needed:
- Response format mismatch
- Missing tool handler pattern
- No Base64 encoding support
- Limited error context

### Phase 1.1 Goals
1. Align response format with reference
2. Implement scalable tool architecture
3. Add enterprise features (Base64, validation)
4. Enhance error handling

### Impact on Timeline
- Adds 1 day to schedule
- Prevents technical debt
- Enables easier Phase 2+ development
- Aligns with production patterns

## Completed Features

### Phase 1 ‚úÖ
- **Unity Package**
  - TCP server on port 6400
  - Command queue processing
  - JSON command parsing
  - Connection status tracking
- **Node.js Server**
  - MCP protocol implementation
  - Unity TCP client
  - Auto-reconnection
  - Ping tool
- **Testing**
  - 95%+ code coverage
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - E2E tests

## Upcoming Features

### Next: Phase 1.1 (1 day)
- Response format standardization
- Tool handler architecture
- Base64 encoding
- Enhanced errors

### Then: Phase 2 (4 days)
- Create GameObject
- Modify GameObject
- Delete GameObject
- Find GameObject
- Hierarchy management

## Technical Metrics

### Performance
- Ping latency: <10ms ‚úÖ
- Connection time: <100ms ‚úÖ
- Command processing: <5ms ‚úÖ

### Quality
- Test coverage: 95%+ ‚úÖ
- Documentation: Complete for Phase 1 ‚úÖ
- Error handling: Basic ‚úÖ ‚Üí Enhanced (Phase 1.1)

### Scalability
- Current: 1 tool (ping)
- Phase 2: +5 tools
- Final: 30+ tools

## Risk Assessment

### On Track ‚úÖ
- Core communication
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation practices

### Needs Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Architecture alignment (Phase 1.1)
- Response format (Phase 1.1)
- Tool scalability (Phase 1.1)

### Future Risks üîç
- Unity API changes
- Performance at scale
- Complex tool interactions

## Development Velocity

### Phase 1 Metrics
- Planned: 3 days
- Actual: 3 days ‚úÖ
- Test coverage achieved: 95%+
- Documentation: Complete

### Projected Timeline
- Phase 1.1: 1 day
- Phases 2-7: 21 days (core features)
- Phases 8-11: 18 days (polish & release)
- Total: 43 days (1 day added for 1.1)

## Key Decisions Made

### Phase 1
1. Node.js over Python (modern, familiar)
2. Direct MCP implementation (control)
3. TDD approach (quality)
4. Comprehensive documentation

### Phase 1.1 Planning
1. Adopt reference architecture patterns
2. Standardize response format
3. Add enterprise features
4. Maintain backward compatibility

## Success Indicators

### Phase 1 ‚úÖ
- Working TCP communication
- Successful ping/pong
- Stable connection
- Clean codebase

### Overall Project
- [ ] 30+ working tools
- [ ] <100ms response time
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Active community

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start Phase 1.1 implementation
2. **This Week**: Complete Phase 1.1 and begin Phase 2
3. **This Month**: Complete through Phase 5
4. **Long Term**: Full release by Day 42
