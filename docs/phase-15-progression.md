## Current Priorities
1. **Timestamp Infrastructure** - Start with time-based filtering foundation
2. **Output Format System** - Implement format conversion framework
3. **Search Performance** - Design indexing and optimization strategy

## Dependencies
- Enhanced logging infrastructure
- Search indexing system
- Time handling utilities
- Format conversion libraries

## Known Risks
- Memory usage with large log sets
- Search performance degradation
- Regex performance issues
- Timestamp synchronization across systems

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Timestamp filtering with sub-second precision
- [ ] Multiple output formats working correctly
- [ ] Advanced search under 100ms for typical queries
- [ ] Pattern analysis and anomaly detection functional
- [ ] Enhanced stack trace parsing operational
- [ ] Memory usage under 50MB for 10k logs
- [ ] Full test coverage achieved

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Targets
- Timestamp queries: < 50ms for 1-hour ranges
- Format conversion: < 100ms for 1000 log entries
- Regex search: < 200ms for typical patterns
- Analysis operations: < 500ms for pattern detection

### Memory Management
- Circular buffer for recent logs (configurable size)
- Compressed storage for historical logs
- Efficient string handling and pooling
- Garbage collection optimization

### Search Optimization
- Inverted index for text search
- Time-based partitioning
- Regex compilation caching
- Result pagination and streaming

## Next Steps
1. Design timestamp tracking and indexing system
2. Research efficient log storage and retrieval
3. Plan search indexing architecture
4. Create format conversion framework
